            <h1>Almamater</h1>
            <h2>SD Negeri 251 Jamika </h2>
            <p>I had a memorable and inspiring journey during my time at SD Negeri 251 Jamika. Throughout my years there, 
              I was fortunate to achieve several milestones that shaped my passion for learning and striving for excellence.
              I was honored to be named the overall champion (juara umum) at the school and also achieved the highest score in the national exams. 
              These accomplishments were a testament to the dedication and support of my teachers, family, and peers. 
              I also had the privilege of representing the school in the Science Olympiad (OSN IPA), which was an exciting and challenging experience.
              In addition to academic achievements, I pursued extracurricular activities and earned several awards, 
              such as 1st place in the district-level scouting competition for boys (Juara 1 Puisi Penggalang Putra Tingkat Kecamatan) and 
              3rd place in the district-level Arabic calligraphy competition (Juara 3 Kaligrafi Arab Tingkat Kecamatan).

              SD Negeri 251 Jamika was not just a school for me but a place where I learned valuable lessons, discovered my potential, 
              and created lifelong memories. It will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
            
            <h2>SMP Negeri 5 Bandung</h2>
            <p>My time at SMP Negeri 5 Bandung was filled with opportunities to grow both academically and personally. 
              It was a period where I embraced challenges and achieved milestones that I am proud of. One of the highlights of my journey was 
              winning 1st place in the "KIM Dengar" competition during a city-level scouting event in Bandung. This achievement not only strengthened 
              my problem-solving and teamwork skills but also deepened my love for the scouting movement. 
              I was also honored to represent my school in the Social Science Olympiad (OSN IPS) at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. 
              Unfortunately, the competition was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the experience of preparing for it was invaluable 
              and taught me resilience in the face of challenges.
              Additionally, I explored my passion for public speaking and was awarded 1st place in the school-level Islamic preaching competition (Lomba Dakwah Tingkat Sekolah). 
              This experience further enhanced my confidence and ability to communicate effectively.
              
             SMP Negeri 5 Bandung was a pivotal stage in my journey, where I developed skills, pursued passions, 
              and formed meaningful connections that continue to inspire me today.</p>
            
            <h2>SMA Negeri 6 Bandung</h2>
            <p>My journey at SMAN 6 Bandung was a transformative and fulfilling chapter in my academic life. It was a time of significant achievements 
              and personal growth that prepared me for future challenges. 
              During my time there, I was honored to be ranked 1st parallel in the Mathematics and Science track, earning the title of the best graduate of my class. 
              This accomplishment reflected my dedication to academic excellence and my passion for learning.
              Beyond academics, I also had the privilege of competing in various events. 
              I won 1st place in the Religious Olympiad during the Islamic Education Competition at the city level in Bandung, which was a deeply rewarding experience. 
              Additionally, I represented my school in the Mathematics Olympiad (OSN Matematika), an opportunity that challenged my problem-solving abilities and broadened my perspective.
              
              SMAN 6 Bandung provided me with a platform to grow holistically, both academically and personally. It was a place where I nurtured my aspirations 
              and built a foundation for my future endeavors.</p>
            
            <h2>Institut Teknologi Bandung</h2>
            <p>Becoming a student at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) is a dream come true and a milestone I have aspired to since childhood. 
              I am proud to be part of this prestigious institution, where I am continually inspired to pursue excellence.
              At ITB, I chose to focus on Earth sciences through the Faculty of Earth Sciences and Technology. 
              This field reflects my passion for understanding the planet we live on and contributes to solving real-world challenges.
              Currently, I am working hard to achieve new dreams and aspirations here at ITB. Each day is an opportunity to grow, learn, 
              and push my boundaries as I strive to make the most of this incredible journey. 
              Being here is not just about fulfilling a childhood dream; it is about creating a future filled with purpose and impact</p>
